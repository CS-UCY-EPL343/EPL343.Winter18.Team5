# 2.1 Product Perspective  

This system consists of an offline mobile application for Android®. In its first release, the application will assist the user by tracking varius statistics relevant to hang gliding and presenting them off-line of the flight. In further versions, the application will also assist the user on-line the flight.

The application will be using GPS to gather location data  __only__ during the flight. The location data will be used to track the user in 2D space while in flight and construct the path.

Since a lot of data will be generated by the application, an offline database that is device specific will be used to store the data.

The initial release will gather data about temperature, humidity, speed, acceleration, location, of which, only location will be gathered from the phone device itself. Humidity, temperature and acceleration will be gathered by __[[INSERT NAME HERE]]__ which is provided by SignalGenerix.


## 2.1.1 System Interfaces

The product is an accessory to the common devices employed by hang-gliders, professional or not and does not communicate with any of them. The product communicates with a GPS system through the phone for 2D positional tracking, and __[[INSERT NAME HERE]]__ to gather data about temperature, humidity and acceleration.

## 2.1.2 User Interfaces

The system contains a navigation menu with the following entries which represent different screens:
  
 * About
 * History
 * Statistics
 * Settings

### About  
About is the homescreen/first screen that comes up when the user opens the application and it will contain:

 * Actions:
   * Record a flight.
 * A small presentation of the last flight and its data.
 * Some wheather information

### History

History page shows a list of previously recorded flights, along with their datetime and any custom name provided by the user. The entries allow clicking on them which transitions the user to a page specifically for the selected flight and will be referred as Flight.

#### Flight

Flight page presents all the gathered data in graphs where applicable as a function of time, such statistics are humidity, temperature, speed, directional acceleration, altitude, altitude change.

### Statistics

Statistics presents the average, minimum and maximum statistics for a specific datapoint. Such statistics are, top 2D speed, maximum altitude decrease/decrease rate, max/min temperature, directional acceleration.

### Settings

Settings screen provides varius options the user can adjust to personalize their experience.

## 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces

### [[Insert name here]]
__[[Insert name here]]__ will be used to track humidity, temperature and acceleration. __[[insert name here]]__ is provided by SignalGenerix and connection to the hardware device is done over Bluetooth®. Additionally, the communication layer between  Bluetooth® and __[[Insert name here]]__ is provided by SignalGenerix.

## 2.1.4 Software Interfaces

### Operating System:

The Operating System (OS) is device dependent, however, Android ® Marshmallow (6.0) which will be referred as MM, will be used as baseline due to its market share and compatibility between it, and later versions. 
Android MM’s specification exists __here__.

### Database:  
The system will be using SQLite®. SQLite is provided by the Operating System and as such, version number and specification number vary. Documentation for SQLite is provided by Google __here__.
SQLite is used as a means to store information generated by the application.

## 2.1.5 Communications Interfaces

The application will be employing an Internet connection to pull weather data based on geolocation.
